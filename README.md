# Word-Guess-Application
Embark on a lexical adventure with our engaging web application, designed to test your vocabulary and deduction skills. This interactive game presents a delightful challenge: guessing a randomly selected word fetched from an external API.

Upon launching the application, you'll be greeted with a visual representation of the mystery word, displayed as a series of blank spaces, each corresponding to a letter. Your task is to decipher the word by strategically guessing individual letters. The application provides a user-friendly interface where you can input your guesses, one letter at a time.

As you submit your guesses, the application instantly evaluates them against the hidden word. Correct guesses are rewarded with the revelation of the corresponding letters in their proper positions within the blank spaces, gradually unveiling the word's structure. Conversely, incorrect guesses are diligently tracked, and a counter displays the number of attempts you've made.

The game's mechanics are designed to strike a balance between challenge and accessibility. The number of allowed incorrect guesses is carefully calibrated to provide a fair opportunity for players of varying skill levels. This ensures that the game remains engaging and enjoyable, encouraging players to think critically and strategically about their guesses.

The application's dynamic nature stems from its reliance on an external API, which provides a constantly refreshed pool of words. This ensures that each playthrough offers a unique and unpredictable challenge, preventing monotony and fostering a sense of discovery. The API's diverse word selection caters to a broad range of vocabulary levels, making the game suitable for both casual players and seasoned word enthusiasts.

The user interface is designed with clarity and simplicity in mind, allowing players to focus on the core gameplay experience.
